This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

Approximately 79% of our paper production capacity is in the U.S. and the remaining 21% is located in Canada.\",\r\n     \"website\": \"http:\\/\\/www.domtar.com\\/\",\r\n     \"phone\": \"877-877-4685\",\r\n     \"address\": \"100 Kingsley Park Drive\\r\\nFort Mill (SC) United-States\\r\\n29715-6476\",\r\n     \"videos\": [\r\n     \"media-and-solutions-lab--video\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"papers\": [\r\n         \"cougar-digital--paper\",\r\n         \"cougar-digital-choice-supersmooth--paper\",\r\n         \"cougar-digital-nat-txt-sm--paper\",\r\n         \"domtar-copy-160-smooth--paper\",\r\n         \"earthchoice-color-tag---paper\",\r\n         \"earthchoice-digital-book--paper\",\r\n         \"earthchoice-tradebook,-vellum--paper\",\r\n         \"huskey-offset-160-smooth--paper\",\r\n         \"husky-offset-smooth--paper\",\r\n         \"laser-form-bond-mocr--paper\",\r\n         \"lynx--paper\",\r\n         \"lynx-digital--paper\",\r\n         \"lynx-digital-card-stock-cover--paper\",\r\n         \"lynx-opaque-digital--paper\",\r\n         \"lynx-ultra-smooth-cover--paper\"\r\n     ]\r\n },\r\n */\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/stores/MillStore.js\n **/","\"use strict\";\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\nvar _slice = Array.prototype.slice;\nexports.loopAsync = loopAsync;\nexports.mapAsync = mapAsync;\n\nfunction loopAsync(turns, work, callback) {\n  var currentTurn = 0,\n      isDone = false;\n  var sync = false,\n      hasNext = false,\n      doneArgs = undefined;\n\n  function done() {\n    isDone = true;\n    if (sync) {\n      // Iterate instead of recursing if possible.\n      doneArgs = [].concat(_slice.call(arguments));\n      return;\n    }\n\n    callback.apply(this, arguments);\n  }\n\n  function next() {\n    if (isDone) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    hasNext = true;\n    if (sync) {\n      // Iterate instead of recursing if possible.\n      return;\n    }\n\n    sync = true;\n\n    while (!isDone && currentTurn < turns && hasNext) {\n      hasNext = false;\n      work.call(this, currentTurn++, next, done);\n    }\n\n    sync = false;\n\n    if (isDone) {\n      // This means the loop finished synchronously.\n      callback.apply(this, doneArgs);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    if (currentTurn >= turns && hasNext) {\n      isDone = true;\n      callback();\n    }\n  }\n\n  next();\n}\n\nfunction mapAsync(array, work, callback) {\n  var length = array.length;\n  var values = [];\n\n  if (length === 0) return callback(null, values);\n\n  var isDone = false,\n      doneCount = 0;\n\n  function done(index, error, value) {\n    if (isDone) return;\n\n    if (error) {\n      isDone = true;\n      callback(error);\n    } else {\n      values[index] = value;\n\n      isDone = ++doneCount === length;\n\n      if (isDone) callback(null, values);\n    }\n  }\n\n  array.forEach(function (item, index) {\n    work(item, index, function (error, value) {\n      done(index, error, value);\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/react-router/lib/AsyncUtils.js\n ** module id = 85\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?
